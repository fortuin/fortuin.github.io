[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge, working in the Machine Learning Group with Richard Turner. I am also a Research Fellow at St. John‚Äôs College and my research is supported by a Postdoc.Mobility Fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation. My research focuses on the interface between deep learning and probabilistic modeling. I am particularly keen to develop models that are more interpretable and data efficient, following the Bayesian paradigm. To this end, I am mostly trying to find better priors and more efficient inference techniques for Bayesian deep learning. Apart from that, I am also interested in deep generative modeling, meta-learning, and PAC-Bayesian theory.\nI did my undergraduate studies in Molecular Life Sciences at the University of Hamburg, where I worked on phylogeny inference for quickly mutating virus strains with Andrew Torda. I then went to ETH Z√ºrich to study Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (in a joint program with the University of Z√ºrich), with a focus on systems biology and machine learning. My master‚Äôs studies were suported by an ETH Excellence Scholarship. My master‚Äôs thesis was about the application of deep learning to gene regulatory network inference under supervision of Manfred Claassen, for which I received the Willi Studer Prize. During my master‚Äôs studies, I also spent some time in Jacob Hanna‚Äôs group at the Weizmann Institute of Science, working on multiomics data analysis in stem cell research. I then did my PhD in Computer Science at ETH Z√ºrich under the supervision of Gunnar R√§tsch and Andreas Krause, where I was a member of the Biomedical Informatics group as well as the ETH Center for the Foundations of Data Science. I was supported by a PhD fellowship from the Swiss Data Science Center and was also an ELLIS PhD student. Within my PhD studies, I visited and worked with Stephan Mandt at the University of California in Irvine and Richard Turner at the University of Cambridge. Moreover, I completed internships at Disney Research Z√ºrich, working with Romann Weber on deep learning for natural language understanding in the Machine Intelligence and Data Science team, at Microsoft Research Cambridge, working with Katja Hofmann on uncertainty quantification in deep learning in the Game Intelligence team, and at Google Brain, working with Efi Kokiopoulou and Rodolphe Jenatton on uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection in the Reliable Deep Learning team. My Erd√∂s‚ÄìBacon number is 6.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"9ef99e44a5b1b47523ad4aad6c4c8dc1","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge, working in the Machine Learning Group with Richard Turner.
